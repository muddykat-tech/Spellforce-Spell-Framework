## Overview
The Spellforce Spell Framework (SFSF) is a project designed to assist developers in creating new spell types and spell logic for the game Spellforce 1. This framework is tailored for the beta version of Spellforce 1 Platinum edition, available exclusively on Steam.

## Installation
To use the Spellforce Spell Framework, follow these steps:
1. Download the `sfsf.asi` file from the [release page](https://github.com/muddykat-tech/Spellforce-Spell-Framework/releases) of this GitHub repository.
2. Move the `sfsf.asi` file into the base game directory of Spellforce 1.
3. For any mods utilizing this framework, ensure they are placed in a subfolder named "sfsf" within the game directory.

## Testing and Bug Reporting
Please note that the Spellforce Spell Framework is currently in its early stages of development and may contain bugs. Your feedback, bug reports, and testing are highly appreciated to improve the framework. Kindly submit bug reports through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/muddykat-tech/Spellforce-Spell-Framework/issues) on GitHub.

## Getting Started with Mod Creation
If you're interested in creating mods using the Spellforce Spell Framework, you can follow this quick tutorial:
1. Obtain the necessary API files from a release version available on the [repository](https://github.com/muddykat-tech/Spellforce-Spell-Framework/tree/master/src/api).
2. You can find an example of how to build a mod [here](https://github.com/muddykat-tech/Spellforce-Spell-Framework/tree/master/src/dev)
3. For assistance with compilation, you can examine the makefile target "mods" on the repo.
4. To debug your mod, you can use x64dbg (x32dbg version) and attach it to spellforce, once you do this, restart the debugger using the refreash symbol to ensure you capture all logs. (We use this process to debug our framework!)
